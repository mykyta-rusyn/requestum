Simple login flow. In the main branch, you can see the Reanimated version. But, also
  * Welcome screen with 2 buttons.
  * Login screen with some different content for Login of Signup flow.
  * Animated inputs, layout animation for the button on the Login screen
  * Home screen with some information
  * Saving user data in the AsyncStorage

Also, there is a different branch with opened PR. Here I used styled-components for styling and React Native Animated for animations.
Because React Native Animated doesn't support different layout animations for each view, I used LayoutAnimation API for smooth transitions
